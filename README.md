Simulate logic circuits in Blockland

### Wires
Wires will connect to each other if they are the same color. If their state is high, they will have a glow FX applied to them.

Visual wires receive FX updates while normal wires do not when the option is enabled.

Clicking a wire will display info about it.

### Gates
Gates consist of input and output ports. Ports will connect to any wire or port.

Clicking a gate or port will display info about it.

### Events
onPowerChange, onPowerOn, and onPowerOff are called on the Event Wire brick.

setInputState will set the state of a gate under the "Inputs" category in the brick menu.

### Gatemaker
The gatemaker is a tool used to design gate bricks.

To begin using it, use `/lMakeGate x y z`

The print on the gate is orientated to face the y+ direction.
